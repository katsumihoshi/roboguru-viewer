# RoboGuru Viewer

A simple browser extension to unlock Roboguru answers without logging in.

## Background

RuangGuru (the parent company of RoboGuru) requires users to sign up for their services in order to unlock answers which involves sharing personal information, such as phone numbers to said company, which may be used for marketing purposes and third-party purposes. In some cases, users might also need to pay to unlock answers.

As someone who values anonymity and privacy, I found this process very frustrating. To address this, I created this extension to bypass the marketing steps and unlock the answers directly without the need to sign up for RoboGuru's services.

## Installation

#### Downloading the extension

Download the extension by clicking the `Code` dropdown button on the repository page and selecting `Download ZIP`. Once the download is complete, extract the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.

#### Installing the extension
1. Open your browser and head to the extension page (in Chrome it will be `chrome://extensions/` and in Microsoft Edge it will be `edge://extensions/`).  
2. Enable **Developer mode** by toggling the switch in the top-right corner of the Extensions page.  
3. Click on the `Load unpacked` button.  
4. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension files, and select the folder.  
5. The extension will now be installed and visible in your extensions list.
## How to Use the Extension  

1. Click on the extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the extension.  
2. Ensure that the `Master Switch` is turned on.  
3. Navigate to a RoboGuru page where you want to unlock an answer.  
4. The extension will automatically unlock the answer for you.

## Troubleshooting

If the extension doesnâ€™t work as expected, ensure the following:  

- You have followed all installation steps correctly.  
- Ensure you have the most recent version of your browser (at least one that supports Manifest V3).
- The extension is enabled in the browser's extensions menu.
- If the extension does not unlock the answer, try reloading the page while ensuring that the "Master Switch" is still turned on.
